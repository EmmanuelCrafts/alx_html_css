# HTML Advanced Project

## Project Overview
This project involves building a webpage from scratch based on a Figma designer file. The current focus is solely on implementing the proper HTML structure using semantic elements, without any CSS styling.

## Figma Design Reference
The design file is available on Figma:
- [Page in Figma](figma-link)
- Fonts used: Source Sans Pro and Spin Cycle OT

## Project Structure
The HTML structure will include the following sections:

### Header Section
- Contains logo/link with image
- Navigation block with 3 links

### Main Content
1. **Banner Section**
   - Primary heading and supporting text
   - Call-to-action button
   - Secondary heading with 4 feature blocks (each with image, heading, and text)

2. **Quote Section**
   - Author image
   - Blockquote with citation
   - Author information

3. **Videos Section**
   - Section heading
   - 4 video blocks, each containing:
     - Thumbnail image
     - Video title
     - Description
     - Author info (image + name)
     - Rating (star images + text)

4. **Membership Section**
   - Section heading
   - 4 membership tiers, each with:
     - Icon/image
     - Tier name
     - Description
     - Sign-up button

5. **FAQ Section**
   - Divided into two rows
   - Each row contains two FAQ items (heading + answer)

### Footer
- Logo/image
- Social media links (as images)
- Copyright text

## Implementation Notes
- All HTML is being written from scratch
- Using semantic HTML5 elements
- Proper heading hierarchy is maintained
- CSS styling will be added in a subsequent project
- Float values from design are rounded as needed

## Next Steps
After completing the HTML structure, the next phase will involve:
- Adding CSS to match the Figma design
- Implementing responsive design
- Adding interactivity where needed
