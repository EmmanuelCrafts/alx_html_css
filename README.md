# CSS Basic â€“ ALX Frontend Project

Welcome to my CSS Basics project, part of the ALX Frontend curriculum. In this project, I explored the fundamentals of styling web pages using CSS. I learned how to use different types of stylesheets, apply layout techniques with Flexbox, and build responsive web pages without relying on external libraries.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I was able to:

- Understand what CSS is and its role in web development
- Add styles to HTML elements using various methods
- Use classes and selectors effectively
- Compute and understand CSS specificity
- Work with box model properties like margin, padding, border, and content
- Apply layout techniques using CSS Flexbox
- Understand how a browser loads and renders a webpage

## Requirements

- All files end with a new line
- A `README.md` file is included at the root of the project
- No use of external libraries or frameworks (only HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
- All code is W3C compliant and validated with W3C-Validator

## Tasks Completed

### 0. Some Early Styling

Created `base.css` and `styles.css`, then linked them in the HTML files using the `<link>` tag. This step introduced external styling to improve the visual structure of the pages.

### 1. Positioning

Used CSS Flexbox to create a structured layout:

- `<body>` was styled with `flex-direction: column`
- `<main>` used `flex-direction: row`
- Applied `flex: 2` to `<article>` and `flex: 1` to `<aside>` for proportional widths
- Enabled scrolling within `<article>` and `<aside>` using `overflow-y: auto`

### 2. Responsive Web Design

Made the page responsive for mobile devices by:

- Adding `class="works_on_smartphone"` to the `<body>` tag
- Including the viewport meta tag to ensure proper scaling on smaller screens

### 3. More Styling

Personalized the page further by:

- Adding visual enhancements like colors and borders
- Customizing the content inside `<article>`
- Adding a Unicode character as a simple logo in the header, styled using the `.logo` class

## Final Thoughts

This project helped solidify my understanding of CSS fundamentals, layout strategies, and responsive design. It gave me hands-on experience in creating clean, adaptable web pages using only HTML and CSS, and I feel more confident moving forward in my frontend development journey.
