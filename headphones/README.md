# Personal Web Page Project

This is a fully responsive, accessible, and mobile-friendly personal web page built from scratch using only HTML and CSS. The design was based on a Figma file created by UI/UX designer Nicolas Philippot.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to replicate a professional web page design without using any JavaScript or CSS frameworks like Bootstrap. The final page closely follows the design, ensuring consistency across both desktop and mobile views.

## Key Concepts Applied

- Semantic HTML5 structure  
- Clean and scalable CSS3 styling  
- Responsive design using media queries  
- Accessibility best practices (alt text, button roles, contrast)  
- Hover and active states for links and buttons

## Final Result

The web page visually matches the Figma design and adjusts correctly to different screen sizes.

Figma design file: 

## Requirements Followed

- No external CSS framework used (e.g., Bootstrap)
- No JavaScript used
- Figma file analyzed and design matched
- Mobile version activated at screen width 480px or less
- Link hover/active state: `#FF6565`
- Button hover/active state: `opacity: 0.9`
- Maximum content width: 1000px, centered

## Responsiveness

| Device  | Width     | Layout                                  |
|---------|-----------|------------------------------------------|
| Desktop | > 480px   | Full layout with multiple sections       |
| Mobile  | â‰¤ 480px   | Stacked layout, optimized for mobile use |

## Tools Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- Figma (for design reference)  
- VS Code (for development)

## Acknowledgements

- Design by Nicolas Philippot  
- Fonts used: Source Sans Pro and Spin Cycle OT (available in the Figma resources)  
- All interactions and layout rules were implemented as per the project requirements

## How to View the Project

1. Clone the repository  
2. Open the `index.html` file in a browser  
3. Resize the browser window to test responsiveness

This project is part of my journey in mastering frontend development. All code and styling were written manually to better understand layout systems, responsive behavior, and accessibility principles.
